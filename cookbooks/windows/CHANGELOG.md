v1.8.10
-------
When using Windows qualified filepaths (C:/foo), the #absolute? method
for URI returns true, because "C" is the scheme.

This change checks that the URI is http or https scheme, so it can be
passed off to remote_file appropriately.

v1.8.8
------

  causes chef run failure
* [COOK-2368] - `version` attribute of the `windows_package` provider
  should be documented

v1.8.2
------
**Important**: Use powershell in nodes expanded run lists to ensure
  powershell is downloaded, as powershell has a dependency on this
  cookbook; v1.8.0 created a circular dependency.
